Script for a DayZ mod that ultimately allows configuration or addition of darkness areas using Namalsk's darkness system.
My script enables easy conversion between two different coordinate systems.
Overall, this script reads location data from a JSON file, processes the coordinates to convert to specified fields, writes the processed data to a new JSON file (processed_coordinates.json), and optionally prints the formatted JSON string to the console for verification or debugging purposes.
